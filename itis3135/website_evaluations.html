                <p>The Hyer website features a captivating illustration of an airplane in motion,
                    creating a visually engaging experience for visitors. Its homepage is thoughtfully
                    designed with key elements for effectiveness: a compelling image that conveys a story,
                    ample white space for clarity, a user-friendly navigation bar, a memorable tagline, and
                    a clear call-to-action. The website's clean and distraction-free design warmly welcomes
                    visitors to explore and discover more about the company.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><span>Contrast</span><p>The website effectively utilizes contrast through the striking airplane illustration that stands out against the background. This contrast grabs visitors' attention and guides their focus to the central visual element.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Repetition</span><p>The website maintains a consistent and cohesive design throughout. It repeats key design elements such as the color palette, typography, and layout elements, creating a harmonious and professional look.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Alignment</span><p>The elements on the website are well-aligned, ensuring a visually pleasing and organized layout. The airplane illustration and other components are appropriately positioned, contributing to a balanced and user-friendly interface.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Proximity</span><p>The website employs proximity effectively by grouping related elements together. The navigation bar, tagline, and call-to-action are strategically placed, making it easy for visitors to understand the website's purpose and navigate seamlessly.</p></li>

                <h3><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/">The Big Ugly Website</a></h3>
                <p>The Big Ugly Website appears to be intentionally designed to serve as an example of a poorly crafted
                    website while trying to showcase other poorly made websites. Its single page exhibits a lack of cohesive
                    design due to questionable color choices, the repetition of the same image everywhere with inconsistent ratios,
                    and it also lacks a mobile-friendly layout (which at this point is the least of our concerns). Furthermore, the
                    user experience worsens when navigating through its links. Additionally, the non-clickable "f" icon in the top
                    left corner adds to the overall unfavorable impression of the website.
                </p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><span>Contrast</span><p>The website seems to have a poor understanding of contrast. The color choices used on the site do not create a visually pleasing or effective contrast, contributing to an unattractive and hard-to-read design.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Repetition</span><p>The website contains multiple pages (that are hard to find and navigate to) with extremely inconsistent colors and patterns, this inconsistency in design and the absence of a cohesive visual theme further accentuate the negative aspect of repetition. This creates confusion and a disjointed user experience, making it challenging for visitors to navigate and engage with the content effectively.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Alignment</span><p>The only positive of this website seems to be that the page is clearly consisted of 2 columns. These columns however do not align well based on the width of our screens (half of the webpage has no content at all). Additionally, there are images overlaping other images and are clearly not well aligned. This haphazardly placed content results in a cluttered and disorganized appearance, making it challenging for users to navigate.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Proximity</span><p>The information provided shows that the website does not effectively use proximity to group related elements together. It seems that the site is showing random things at random locations. This results in a confusing layout and hinder the user's ability to understand the content and its organization.</p></li>
